# responsive-portfolio
My portfolio website that is mobile and tablet friendly.

I used html and css styling to create my previous project. For this project I used Bootstrap for the first time.

Exploring Bootstrap, I was able to learn how to use their sizing and spacing, the 12-column grid layout was especially helpful for designing a responsive website, the Navbar, image and positioning. Overall a very fruitful experience  .
